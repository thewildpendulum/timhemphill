This is the repo for my professional website and blog. It runs on node.js and Backbone. Making it gave me the excuse to also try out Coffeescript and Yeoman. I use EpicEditor and marked to write and publish new posts straight from the site and I store everything in a mongo database with mongoskin.

Feel free to poke around. Once the site is up, there will be blog posts about how I put everything together.
